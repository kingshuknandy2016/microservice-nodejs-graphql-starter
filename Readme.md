## Getting Started

### Step 1: Set up the Development Environment

You need to set up your development environment before you can do anything.

Install [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
### Step 2: Set up Application Database

Get your application DB up. Ensure that you have docker installed. We are using **Postgres Docker container** as the Database

```cmd
docker pull postgres
```

```cmd
docker run --name postgres-db -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -d postgres
```

### Step 2: Create new Project

Fork or download this project. Configure your package.json for your new project.

Then copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. In this file you have to add your database connection information.

Create a new database with the name you have in your `.env`-file.

Then setup your application environment.


## ❯ Scripts and Tasks

All script are defined in the `package.json` file, but the most important ones are listed here.

### Install
- Install all dependencies with `npm install`

### Linting
- For linting execute the command `npm run eslint:fix`

### Tests
- Run the unit tests using `npm test`

### Running in dev mode
- Run `npm run dev` to start nodemon with ts-node, to serve the app.

### Building the project and run it
- Then start the application
```cmd
npm run start:dev
```


## ❯ Important URL
- **Application Health** http://localhost:3000/health
- **Graphql Server** 
  - http://localhost:3000/graphql or 
  - https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/explorer?endpoint=http://localhost:3000/graphql
- **Swagger** http://localhost:3000/api-docs/

In order to access the private the routes, we need to pass the JWT token generated by the login API

## ❯ API Routes

The route prefix is `/api` by default, but you can change this in the .env file.
The swagger and the monitor route can be altered in the `.env` file.

| Route          | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| **/health**    | Get the health of server |
| **/apis/v1**   | The Api server details |
| **/graphql**   | Route to the graphql editor or your query/mutations requests |
| **/api-docs/** | This is the Swagger UI with our API documentation |

### Example Entity Endpoint
```sh
# Public API Routes:
+--------+------------------------------+
  Method | URI
+--------+------------------------------+
  GET    | /health
  POST   | /apis/v1/auth/signUp
  POST   | /apis/v1/auth/login
  GET    | /apis/v1/employees/getEmployeeBasic
  GET    | /apis/v1/employees/getEmployees
  POST   | /apis/v1/employees/setEmployee
+--------+------------------------------+

# Private API Routes:
+--------+------------------------------+
  Method | URI
+--------+------------------------------+
  GET    | /apis/v1/users/getUsersBasic
  GET    | /apis/v1/users/getUsers
  POST   | /apis/v1/users/setUser
+--------+------------------------------+
```

## ❯ Logging

Our logger is winston. 

```javascript
export interface Log {
  level: "info" | "debug" | "error" | "warn";
}
const logger = winston.createLogger({
  transports: [new winston.transports.Console({ level: LOG.level })],
});
export default logger;
```
## ❯ Seeding

Yet to be implemented

## ❯ Role Based Access
Yet to be implemented

## ❯ GraphQL
For the GraphQL part we used the library [Apollo Server 4](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/schema/schema/) to build awesome GraphQL API's.

First you need to login with username and password
```gql
  mutation SampleQuery {
    login(email:"rama.sharma@gmail.com",password:"test@1234"){
      token
      email
      name
    }
}

```
Then we need to pass this ***token*** as a header for every graphql call
```gql
query getAllTheUsers{
  getAllUsers {
    name
    email
  }
}
``` 

## ❯ Docker
Here we will try to spin up two containers.
- postgres
- microservice
There has to be a common network attached to both of them so that they will be able to communicate with each other

### Step A: Install Docker
Before you start, make sure you have a recent version of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) installed

### Step B: Create a network
In order to communicate between containers we need to create a [user-defined custom bridge networks](https://docs.docker.com/network/drivers/bridge/)
```cmd
  docker network create -o com.docker.network.bridge.enable_icc=true custom-network
```

### Step C: Run the Database Image
Then, Get the Postgres DB up. Run the postgres image, passing the newly created network ***custom-network***
```cmd
docker run --network custom-network --name postgres-db -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password postgres
```
### Step D: Build the Application Docker image

```shell
docker build -t <your-image-name> .
```
Then, build the app's image
```cmd
docker build . -t kingshuknandy/node-microservice
```

### Set E: Run the Application docker image in container and map port

Finally, run the app's image, passing the newly created network ***custom-network*** 

The port which runs your application inside Docker container is either configured as `PORT` property in your `.env` configuration file or passed to Docker container via environment variable `PORT`. Default port is `3000`.

```cmd
docker run -p 3000:3000 --network custom-network --env-file .env  --env DB_HOST='postgres-db' --name node-microservice kingshuknandy/node-microservice:latest
```

## ❯ Docker Compose

- Created the [Dockerfile](/Dockerfile) to build the app
- Defined the services that make up the app in [docker-compose.yml](/docker-compose.yml) so they can be run together in an isolated environment.
- Run ***docker-compose up*** and Compose starts and runs your entire app.
```cmd
docker-compose up
```
